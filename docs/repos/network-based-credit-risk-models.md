# Network-Based Credit Risk Models in P2P Lending Markets

**SNSF Research Project** - Swiss National Science Foundation

## Overview

This research project focuses on developing advanced, interpretable credit risk models tailored specifically to the needs of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending markets. The project addresses the unique challenges of P2P lending, such as higher information asymmetry, less regulation, and increased risk during economic downturns.

## Team

**Principal Investigator:** Joerg Osterrieder (Bern Business School, Switzerland / University of Twente, Netherlands)

**Team Members:**
- Lennart John Baals (Bern Business School / University of Twente)
- Branka Hadji Misheva (Bern Business School)
- Yiting Liu (Bern Business School / University of Twente)
