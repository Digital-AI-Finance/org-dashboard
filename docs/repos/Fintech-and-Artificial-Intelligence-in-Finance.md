## Action Description

The financial sector is the largest user of digital technologies and a major driver in the digital transformation of the economy. Financial technology (FinTech) aims to both compete with and support the established financial industry in the delivery of financial services. Globally, more than $100 billion of investments have been made into FinTech companies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) since 2010, and continue growing substantially.

In early 2018, the European Commission unveiled (a) their action plan for a more competitive and innovative financial market, and (b) an initiative on AI with the aim to harness the opportunities presented by technology-enabled innovations. Europe should become a global hub for FinTech, with the economy being able to benefit from the European Single Market.

### Key Objectives

1. **Improve transparency of AI-supported processes** in the Fintech space
2. **Address the disparity** between the proliferation in AI models within the financial industry for risk assessment and decision-making, and the limited insight the public has in its consequences by developing policy papers and methods to increase transparency
3. **Develop methods to scrutinize the quality of products**, especially rule-based "smart beta" ones, across the asset management, banking and insurance industries

### Action Keywords

Artificial Intelligence - Fintech - Finance - Transparency - Financial Markets
