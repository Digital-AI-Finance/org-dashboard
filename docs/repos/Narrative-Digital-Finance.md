## Overview

Large fluctuations, instabilities, trends and uncertainty of financial markets constitute a substantial challenge for asset management companies, pension funds and regulators. This project develops a comprehensive framework that utilizes advanced machine learning and NLP techniques to predict market outcomes, detect asset price bubbles, and identify structural breaks using diverse data sources.

## Research Objectives

### Overall Objectives
Develop a comprehensive framework utilizing advanced machine learning and NLP techniques to:
- Predict market outcomes
- Detect asset price bubbles
- Identify structural breaks
- Analyze diverse data sources including financial data and narrative content from text, speech, and multimedia

### Specific Aims
1. Validate and refine existing econometric models using real-world financial data
2. Integrate narrative analysis to understand and predict market behaviors and asset price dynamics
3. Create a multidimensional AI and ML framework that enhances the detection of market anomalies and forecasts financial trends

## Methods

The approach involves:
- Collecting and processing stock prices, macroeconomic indicators, and textual content from the web
- Employing text mining and NLP techniques to analyze sentiment, narrative structures, and their impact on market movements
- Developing and testing new AI models that combine traditional financial analysis with narrative insights
